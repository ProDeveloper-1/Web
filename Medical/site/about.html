			HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999,
			which was likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
			HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015; it is
			now supported by virtually all web browsers[2] and major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
			using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[3] where TLS 1.2 or newer is
			required.[4][5]
			HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2,[6][7] which is already in use on the web, using UDP instead of
			TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the
			protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019,[8][9] and can be
			enabled in the stable versions of Chrome and Firefox.
